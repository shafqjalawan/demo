            <h3>Here Fahter's Child</h3>
            <p>
               There is far more to Suu's career than simple commitment, however vital
               that element is. Suu had been thinking hard for many years about what it meant
               to be the daughter of the man who negotiated Burma's independence. She had a
               profound desire to be a daughter worthy of him, to do something for her nation
               of which both she and he could be proud. The tragic first decades of Burma's
               history as an independent nation, its fragile democracy snuffed out by the army,
               brought home to her how hard it would be to bring her nation into the modern
               world without doing violence to its innermost values. In the years before 1988
               she had devoted much time and research to that question. Suddenly, against all
               odds, she had the opportunity, and the duty, to resolve it. She has not yet
               succeeded. But that is not the same as to say that she has failed.

            <p>

               Is not true that recent Burmese history is an unending catalogue of
               oppression. Any Burmese over the age of thirty-five can remember a time of
               perfect liberty, when a free press flourished and trade unions and political parties
               sprang up like mushrooms after rain.
               Unfortunately the Burma Spring lasted less than one month—twenty-six days
               to be precise. It ended as abruptly as it had begun.
               Yet within that brief span in August and September 1988 Aung San Suu Kyi,
               backed by a shifting and so far nameless coalition of students, intellectuals, old
               politicians and veteran army officers, succeeded in persuading the regime to
               push through three reforms which ensured that Burma would never be the same
               again.
               Aung San, his wife Ma Khin Kyi and their baby, Aung San Oo.

               WILLIAM YETTAW, who lives in a small mobile home in the Ozark
               Mountains, Missouri, is a four-times married Vietnam War veteran and a devout
               Mormon; a man who believes that God speaks to him and sends him on urgent
               missions.His first visit came during a twenty-six day trip to Burma in November 2008.
               During her years of detention, as well as the mother and daughter who kept
               house for her, there were numerous guards both at the razor-wire barricaded
               gate, and inside the house. The first time Yettaw made his way to her home—
               swimming across Inya Lake with the help of homemade wooden flippers—he
               failed to meet her: He was stopped at the shore and eventually sent on his way,
               after leaving a copy of the Book of Mormon for Suu as his visiting card. Acting
               no doubt on information from one of the people who had intercepted him in the
               grounds of her home, he did not swim back across the lake but took the easy way
               out, walking along the lake shore then through a drainage pipe which brought
               him out near the American Embassy.
               Aung San, his wife Ma Khin Kyi and their three children, Aung San Oo, Aung San Lin and Aung San Suu Kyi.
