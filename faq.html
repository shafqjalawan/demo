            <p>Aung San Suu Kyi was two years old when her father died, <q>too young,</q> as
            she put it, “to remember him.”
            In one of the last photographs taken before his death Aung San appears to have mellowed considerably since that nervous, highintensity wedding picture. He and Ma Khin Kyi smile toothily at each other
            across the three children, two sons and a daughter, that she has borne him. 
            One of Aung San's hands holds the hand of Aung San Lin, their younger son, his
            other rests on Suu's shoulder. Suu has protruding ears and looks up at the
            camera in frank alarm. As in the earlier photograph, Ma Khin Kyi has flowers in
            her hair, which is coiled in a cylindrical bun, and she looks as calm, radiant and
            tender as before.

            <p>There are numerous strange and ghostly parallels between the life of the
            heroic father and that of his daughter. It was in 1938 that the so-called
            “Revolution of 1300” occurred, the nationwide outbreak of strikes and protests
            that propelled Aung San and his comrades along the road to independence. And
            it was exactly fifty years later, in 1988, that the greatest uprising in independent
            Burma's history occurred, propelling Suu to the leadership of the democracy
            movement.It was in Rangoon General Hospital in 1941, when he was a patient and she
            was a nurse, that Aung San met his future wife, Ma Khin Kyi; and it was in the
            same hospital forty-seven years later, when Ma Khin Kyi was a patient, having
            suffered a crippling stroke, and Aung San Suu Kyi was nursing her, that she met
            the students wounded when the army fired on their demonstrations; it was also
            outside that same hospital, on August 24, 1988, that she spoke to a political
            meeting for the first time in her life. Two days later she addressed a crowd of
            hundreds of thousands at the Shwedagon pagoda, the national shrine where
            Aung San had lambasted British rule before the war</p>

            IT is not true that recent Burmese history is an unending catalogue of
            oppression. Any Burmese over the age of thirty-five can remember a time of
            perfect liberty, when a free press flourished and trade unions and political parties
            sprang up like mushrooms after rain</p>

             <p>Aung San Suu Kyi with friends in the cast of Anthony and Cleopatra. Suu, whose
            early ambition was to write, made a precocious start at Delhi's Lady Sri Ram
            College, writing and acting in a spoof of Shakespeare's play.
            “In a sense Lady Sri Ram was a finishing school,” said Malavika. “But that's
            not entirely true: My family had a long tradition of Oxbridge and that's what my
            father wanted me to do. It wasn't as if he was going to shove me off into an
            arranged marriage or anything. No way.” Instead Malavika, like Suu, was to take
            a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford.
            While the rest of the gang remained at Lady Sri Ram for two years and
            emerged with degrees, Suu stayed only one year, and much of it she spent
            applying for and then preparing for her move to England. The British High
            Commissioner in Delhi at the time was Sir Paul Gore-Booth; he and his wife
            Lady Pat Gore-Booth had been friends of Daw Khin Kyi when Sir Paul was
            posted at the embassy in Rangoon. Now they very gladly acceded to Daw Khin
            Kyi's request to act as her daughter's guardians while she was in England.</p>

            <p>Did Suu dance too? There seems little doubt that she did. As Ma Thanegi
            recorded in her diary, Suu asked her to find music cassettes to while away the
            hours in the car, and sang along loudly to hits of the late-fifties and very early
            sixties which she remembered from her early teens.
            When she suddenly emerged into Burma's public life in 1988, Suu spoke
            Burmese as her co-nationals did, but she was not Burmese as they were. That
            was because, while the defining experience of Burma for the past fifty years has
            been political and cultural isolation, the defining fact of Suu's life has been the
            opposite: continuous exposure to the world outside Burma in all its variety. Her
            father had learned to speak English fluently, had traveled to China and Japan,
            trained as a soldier in Japan, learned Japanese, then later traveled to London via
            India to parlay with the colonial oppressor-turned-liberator. His daughter had
            had the good fortune to grow up in Rangoon during the only years of its postwar
            history when it was an international town. Then she went abroad, and the
            exposure continued, and never stopped.</p>

            <p>AUNG SAN SUU KYI's timing, like her father's, has always been good. She left
            her homeland just in time to be spared the slow death of her country by military
            rule. She arrived in Delhi in time to experience the last years of Nehru and
            India's transition from dynastic politics. And she arrived in England in the
            middle of the biggest explosion of popular culture the country had ever seen.
            It was 1964, the year the Beatles had number 1 hits with “Can't Buy Me
            Love,” “A Hard Day's Night” and “I Feel Fine.” Harold Wilson became Labor
            prime minister one month after her arrival, ending “thirteen wasted years of Tory
            rule.” Men's hair was creeping down to their shoulders, their trousers were
            acquiring bell-bottoms and their shirt collars expanding to the point of absurdity.
            Skirts were racing up girls' thighs, and erotic boots were closing the gap. Dingy,
            foggy, smoky London, gloomy and sarcastic, woke up to find it was suddenly
            trendy. A man called Moulton invented a bicycle with tiny wheels.
            And Suu blossomed like a lotus flower</p>

        <dd><p>THEY were married in a Buddhist ceremony in the Gore-Booths' home in
            Chelsea, guests wrapping sacred thread around the couple as they sat crosslegged on the floor while a Tibetan lama, Chime Youngdroung Rimpoche, blew
            on a conch shell. “It was a lovely ceremony,” recalled Sir Robin Christopher,
            one of Suu's closest friends from Oxford. “I was one of those who walked
            around them with the holy thread. What a wonderful bond that was to prove to
            be!”
            It was charmingly romantic: two anglophone Buddhists, conjoined a few
            hundred yards from the World's End and Gandalf's Garden—before flying off
            together to make their home in Shangri-La.</p>

             <p>After leaving school, Michael went to Durham University to study Modern
            History. His choice of subject is puzzling because by this time he had become
            intrigued by a subject well off the track of the curriculum: the culture, language,
            religion and history of Tibet.
            This arcane interest had been accidentally implanted by his father when he
            brought a Tibetan prayer-wheel back from a trip to India. Michael became
            fascinated, less by the function of the device—one of the many ways invented by
            Tibetans to express their devotions—than by the mysterious letters inscribed on
            a piece of paper he found inside it. As it happened, one of their teachers at Worth
            School, Andrew Bertie, knew som.</p>
