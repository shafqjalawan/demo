    <p>To blame Suu for being locked up for so many years is perverse, like blaming
        Joan of Arc for being burned at the stake. Yet it is true that her imprisonment has
        in a sense been voluntary, and this is one of the things that explains her enduring
        and almost universal popularity with ordinary Burmese people. Myanmar's ruling National
        League for Democracy (NLD) party has secured enough seats in parliament to form the next government, according
        to the latest election results.
        The NLD has so far won 346 seats, more than the 322 seats needed to form the next government.</p>

    <p>It is this decision—a moral much more than a political decision, and one from
        which she has not deviated in more than twenty years, despite every attempt to
        blackmail her emotionally—which has earned her an unwavering place in the
        hearts of tens of millions of Burmese. She could have flown away, and she never
        did. That has created an unbreakable bond, Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi waves from the

    <p>Aung San Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945, in the Irrawaddy Delta, the
        third of three children, during the most tumultuous years in Burma's history. Her
        father, Aung San, was at the heart of the tumult. Rangoon, the capital, had just
        fallen to the Allies, and her pregnant mother had sought refuge from the fighting
        in the countryside, Myanmar long known as Burma, has been notorious for its repressive
        rule, though there have been signs of reform in recent months,
        such as the easing of media censorship and changes in labor and elections laws.</p>

    <p>Aung San was a boy from the provinces, shy, a poor speaker, with abrupt
        manners, and prone to long unexplained silences.
        5 Short and wiry, with the sort
        of blankness of expression that leads Westerners to describe people from the
        East as inscrutable, he also had something special about him, a charisma. With a
        fiery temper and an iron will, he emerged at Rangoon University in the 1930s as
        one of the most ambitious and determined of the students dedicated to freeing
        Burma from the British.
        The violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State peaked in August 2017 with a campaign of mass rape,
        burnings and drownings against entire families that killed more than 9,000 people and forced nearly one million
        to flee the country.</p>

    <p>But in 1885 the British finished the job, storming Mandalay, the last seat of
        the kings, sacking the palace, burning much of the ancient library and sending
        King Thibaw and his queen Supayalat into exile in western India. They brought
        the whole kingdom into the Indian system, governing it from the Viceroy's
        palace in Calcutta, and supplementing or replacing the local rulers who had been
        the king's allies with British administrators. They brought in tens of thousands
        of troops to suppress the rebellions that kept breaking out, until the Pax
        Britannica prevailed across the country Meiktila, Burma/Myanmar. November

    <p>But by the time Burma had been subdued, the Indians across the border were
        themselves becoming restless. The Indian National Congress had been founded
        in 1885, the year the Burmese monarchy was abolished, and rapidly became the
        focus for Indian hopes of self-government. The First World War weakened the
        empire dramatically. The arrival of Mohandas Gandhi from South Africa gave
        Congress a leader of unique charisma and creativity, and the massacre at
        Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar in 1919 brought home the fact that British rule was
        a confidence trick, with hundreds of millions of Indians kept in check by a threat
        of force that the few thousand British in residence could never carry out
        effectively.The NLD announced on Friday that it was dropping its boycott of elections and would
        put up candidates for all 48 seats that have been available in a series of by-elections left vacant by
        reshuffles</p>

    <p>With peace the British returned, reinstalling their former governor, Sir
        Reginald Dorman-Smith, but they found the situation very different from when
        they had left in 1941. The country's towns and cities had been devastated by the
        battles between the Allies and Japanese; in the British parliament, one MP said
        the degree of destruction in Burma was worse than in any other area in the East.
        And the Burmese under Aung San and his comrades in the AFPFL, hardened by
        years of war and hungry for the freedom for which they had been fighting so
        long, were no longer in a mood to compromise,
        In July 1989 the military government of the newly named Union of Myanmar (since 2011,
        Republic of the Union of Myanmar) placed Suu Kyi under house arrest in Yangon (Rangoon) and held her
        incommunicado.</p>
